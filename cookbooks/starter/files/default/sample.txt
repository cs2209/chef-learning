This is a Chef cookbook file. It is used to copy content verbatim on to a server.
For dynamic or otherwise data-driven content, please see sample.erb in the templates/
directory for an example of using a template resource.
Chef is a configuration management tool.
You can create a cookbook_file resource in a recipe file:

    cookbook_file "/etc/myserver.conf" do
      source "sample.txt"
      owner "root"
      group "root"
      mode "644"
    end
A cookbook_file resource can be used with any context, including binary files.
Once you’re done developing and testing code on your local workstation, you can upload it to the Chef Infra Server. The Chef Infra Server acts as a hub for configuration data. It stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to the systems in your infrastructure and metadata that describes each system. The knife command lets you communicate with the Chef Infra Server from your workstation. For example, you use it to upload your cookbooks.

To get a sense of how the Chef InSpec language works, here are some examples. This Chef InSpec rule ensures that insecure services and protocols, such as telnet, are not used.

describe package('telnetd') do
  it { should_not be_installed }
end

describe inetd_conf do
  its('telnet') { should eq nil }
end
